I decomposed the challenge into tasks that were easier to focus on: 
	1) Changes to the Trip Model 
	2) Adding JSON data to the Trip Model
	3) Updating URL.py to add /trips/ and /trips/1..x
	4) Creating Views for each URL pattern
	5) Using the index.html template to format output to the browser
	
The first few tasks were simple & took a few minutes. I had the most 
difficulty with task #5. It took some time to understand what a template is 
and what django's generic class views are meant for. 

Even though I've completed the challenge, I still want to research and find out how 
to do more complicated taks. I'm curious about the template file especially, I was 
not able to do much formatting or include a style sheet; I also tried getting a response 
via AJAX call and the browser was always blank (I checked my syntax and logged errors). 
I'll definitely be reading more about these issues and hopefully will be able to implement 
both. Overall I really enjoyed working on the challenge and it benefitted me a lot!

Thank you,
